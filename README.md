# Genius Color Game

Genius Color Game - A web-based game that challenges your memory and concentration skills.

## Description

This project is a web-based game inspired by the classic board game "Simon". The game challenges the player's memory and concentration skills by displaying a sequence of colored tiles, which the player must then repeat in the correct order. The game gets progressively more difficult as the sequence gets longer, and the player must complete the sequence without making a mistake.

The game is built using HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript, and utilizes modern web development techniques such as CSS Grid, array manipulation, and arrow functions.
